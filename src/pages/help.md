# How you can help us

We're a small non-profit team of student volunteers passionate about inspiring young minds to expand their educational horizons and career aspirations. There are several ways you can contribute to our mission:

- **Spread the Word**: Share our website and resources with friends, family, and on social media to help us reach a wider audience.
- **Volunteer**: If you have skills in anything STEM-related, content creation, web development, or marketing, consider volunteering your time to help us create and improve our resources.
- **Donate**: Financial contributions help us maintain our website, create new content, and organize events. Every little bit helps!
- **Provide Feedback**: Let us know what you think about our resources and suggest topics you'd like us to cover.

Whether it's sharing our mission, volunteering your skills, donating funds, or providing feedback, your support makes a significant difference in inspiring the next generation. Thank you for being part of our journey!
