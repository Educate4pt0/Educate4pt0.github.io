Each resource includes detailed instructions, materials needed, and learning objectives to help you effectively implement the tutorial, should the tutorial require specific technology or materials, those will be detailed upfront as well.

We recommend reviewing the full tutorial before implementing it to ensure you have a clear understanding of the content and structure.

A printed copy of the tutorial can be very helpful for reference during the tutorial, especially if you are working in an environment where digital access may be limited.
