# Using Quizzes

Add interactive quizzes to your MDX documentation to assess learner understanding.

## Quick Start

Import the Quiz component and create a questions array:

```mdx
import { Quiz } from '@site/src/components/Quiz';

<Quiz
  questions={[
    {
      question: "What is your question?",
      answers: ["The correct answer"],
      distractors: ["Wrong answer 1", "Wrong answer 2"]
    }
  ]}
/>
```

## Question Types

The component automatically detects the type based on your data:

- **Q&A**: Use a single answer, no distractors → shows as expandable answer
- **Single-Select**: Use one answer + distractors → shows multiple choice
- **Multi-Select**: Use multiple answers + distractors → shows checkboxes

## Examples

### Simple Q&A

```mdx
{
  question: "What is 2 + 2?",
  answers: ["4"]
}
```

### Multiple Choice

```mdx
{
  question: "What is Scratch?",
  answers: ["A visual programming language developed by MIT"],
  distractors: ["A text-based programming language", "Computer hardware"]
}
```

### Multi-Select

```mdx
{
  question: "Select all programming concepts:",
  answers: ["Variables", "Loops", "Functions"],
  distractors: ["Pizza", "Skateboard"]
}
```
