# How to Contribute

:::note Reminder
This is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from educators, volunteers, and anyone interested in enhancing our educational resources. If you have a tutorial idea or would like to improve existing content, please follow the guidelines below to contribute effectively.

Keep in mind that all contributions will need to be reviewed for quality and relevance before being merged into the main repository, and these things may take some time.
:::


First some advice; before you start working on a contribution, please check the [issues page](https://github.com/Educate4pt0/Educate4pt0.github.io/issues) to see if your idea has already been suggested or is currently being worked on. If you find an existing issue that matches your idea, feel free to comment on it or express your interest in contributing.

Take a look around the repository to familiarise yourself with the structure and style of existing tutorials. This will help you understand how to format your contribution and ensure consistency across the project.

Try to follow the exisitng style and strucute, if it makes sense to add your content in a new section, please do so. If it fits better within an existing section, please add it there.

## Getting Started

To contribute to this project, you'll need to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for free at [github.com](https://github.com).

Once you have a GitHub account, you can [fork the repository](https://github.com/Educate4pt0/Educate4pt0.github.io/fork) to create your own copy of the project. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

After forking the repository, clone your forked version to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/Educate4pt0.github.io.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Educate4pt0.github.io
```

You can now create a new branch for your contribution. Name your branch descriptively based on the content you're adding or modifying. For example:

```bash
git checkout -b <category>/<description>

# examples
git checkout -b tutorials/add-python-basics
git checkout -b guides/update-example-tutorial
git checkout -b admin/update-nodejs-version
```

Replace `<category>` and `<name>` with appropriate values for your contribution. Available options are listed below:

- **Categories**:
    - `tutorials`: For work done on tutorials
    - `guides`: For work done on guides
    - `admin`: For administrative tasks and maintenance
    - *If you think another category is needed, please open an issue to discuss it first.*
- **Description**: A brief descriptive name for your contribution (use hyphens to separate words)
