# How to Contribute

:::note Reminder
This is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from educators, volunteers, and anyone interested in enhancing our educational resources. If you have a tutorial idea or would like to improve existing content, please follow the guidelines below to contribute effectively.

Keep in mind that all contributions will need to be reviewed for quality and relevance before being merged into the main repository, and these things may take some time.
:::


First some advice; before you start working on a contribution, please check the [issues page](https://github.com/Educate4pt0/Educate4pt0.github.io/issues) to see if your idea has already been suggested or is currently being worked on. If you find an existing issue that matches your idea, feel free to comment on it or express your interest in contributing.

Take a look around the repository to familiarise yourself with the structure and style of existing tutorials. This will help you understand how to format your contribution and ensure consistency across the project.

Try to follow the exisitng style and strucute, if it makes sense to add your content in a new section, please do so. If it fits better within an existing section, please add it there.

## Getting Started

To contribute to this project, you'll need to have a few things:
- GitHub account - If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for free at [github.com](https://github.com).
- `git` installed on your local machine - You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- A code editor - We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- An SSH key set up with your GitHub account for secure authentication. You can follow GitHub's guide on [generating SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
- `npm` installed on your local machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

Once you have a GitHub account, you can [fork the repository](https://github.com/Educate4pt0/Educate4pt0.github.io/fork) to create your own copy of the project. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

After forking the repository, clone your forked version to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/Educate4pt0.github.io.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Educate4pt0.github.io
```

You can now create a new branch for your contribution. Name your branch descriptively based on the content you're adding or modifying. For example:

```bash
git checkout -b <category>/<description>

# examples
git checkout -b tutorials/add-python-basics
git checkout -b guides/update-example-tutorial
git checkout -b admin/update-nodejs-version
```

Replace `<category>` and `<description>` with appropriate values for your contribution. Available options are listed below:

- **Categories**:
    - `tutorials`: For work done on tutorials
    - `guides`: For work done on guides
    - `admin`: For administrative tasks and maintenance
    - *If you think another category is needed, please open an issue to discuss it first.*
- **Description**: A brief descriptive name for your contribution (use hyphens to separate words)

### Pre-commit checks

Enable the repository's pre-commit hook so the same checks run locally before pushing:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit
```

The hook enforces the `<category>/<description>` branch naming pattern (`tutorials`, `guides`, or `admin` categories with hyphenated descriptions) and runs `npm run typecheck` followed by `npm run build` to match the deployment pipeline.

## Making Changes

You can now make changes to the codebase using your preferred code editor.

:::tip Live Preview
To see your changes in real-time, you can run the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```
This will start a local server, and you can view your changes in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
:::


Once you've made your changes, you can stage them for commit using the following command:

```bash
git add <path-to-file1> <path-to-file2> ...
```

:::tip VSCode users
You can also stage changes directly from the Source Control panel in Visual Studio Code by clicking the "+" icon next to the files you've modified.

Write an informative commit message that describes the changes you've made. This helps maintainers understand the purpose of your contribution.

And press the "publish branch" or "sync changes" button in the Source Control panel to push your changes to your forked repository.
:::

Replace `<path-to-file1>`, `<path-to-file2>`, etc. with the paths to the files you've modified or added.

After staging your changes, commit them with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add <description> to <category>"
```

Lastly, push your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

This is the branch you created earlier for your contribution.

## Creating a Pull Request

Once you've pushed your changes, you can create a pull request (PR) to propose your changes to the main repository. Go to the original repository on GitHub, and you'll see a prompt to create a pull request from your recently pushed branch. Click on the "Compare & pull request" button.

Fill out the PR template with relevant information about your contribution, including a clear description of the changes you've made and any additional context that may be helpful for reviewers.

Once you've filled out the PR template, click on the "Create pull request" button to submit your PR for review.

## Review Process

Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers of the project. They may provide feedback or request changes before merging your contribution. Be responsive to feedback and make any necessary adjustments to your PR.

Once your pull request has been approved and merged, your contribution will be part of the main codebase! Congratulations, and thank you for contributing to the Educate4.0 project!
